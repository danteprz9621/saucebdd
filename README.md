I'm using Python 3.10 to run the tests. All of the cases are tested in Chrome browser, chrome driver is also added in the repository.

Packages needed to run tests:
    Selenium (4.1.0 or further)
    Behave (1.2.6)

To run all tests...
     behave .\features\

To run a specific test...
    behave .\features\buyproduct.feature
